# Premise:

    You are the oldest of a group of kids, and as the oldest you have done your part to take care of your fellow brothers and sisters. You have done all you can to care for your siblings, working as a farmer to provide for them, putting food on the table, training for if or when you’d have to protect them from harm. What you were not prepared for, however, was the day that your youngest sister, Grace, would come down with an illness, one that started out small but rapidly progressed as days went by. As it doesn’t seem to be getting better, you find yourself unsure of what to do, to the point where you go and search through book after book for some kind of medicine to help relieve your sister of her illness. After your long search, you find a mysterious book telling of a medicine that can cure any illness, with only three ingredients needed for it to be made: A phoenix’s tail feather, a four leaf clover, and the tears from mother nature herself. These ingredients were rare to come by, and with time of the essence, you decide to travel to a treacherous place known as the Great Confines, a dungeon that extends into the earth, containing all manner of monster and creature alike. With courage and your sword at your side, you must traverse the dungeon to gather the ingredients to save your sister.
